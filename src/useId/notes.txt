a uniqueId per componentInstance.. 
so.. if you have the same component being ran more that once in teh page.. and you need an Id for an element.. 
use this instand of Math.random() for example.. 
this is will be different in for each instance or element.. so taht you dont' have 2 elemetns with same id in one page


for more that element with Id.. and for performance..
