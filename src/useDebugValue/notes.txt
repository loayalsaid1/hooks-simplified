useDebugValue(value);

in customHooks.. it put's {value}. -whatever it's type- as a label besides the hook name in the devtools.. 
becomes an array of the hook used move than once


make it useDebugValue(value, formatterFunction).. will 1. Add the return value.. 2.. it will only run when the ReactDevTools are open.. so it don't slowdown the app incase it's a slow operation.. being for formatting other sort of function
