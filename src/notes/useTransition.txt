useTransition..
It's just a away to say.. hay.. take those .. don't block execution.. execute them away and when you are done .. rerender
and it's giving us a way to know when it's still running it's thign.. via isPending

so it gives is a mean to start this transation... and a way to know when it's still pending

1. startTransation... takes a funciton.. execute it on the side
2. isPending .. the indicator
const [ isPending, startTransation] = useTransation()
