I gate between the a specified value and the component..
or you can name it a fasade over it.. 

when a value is changing too much and something takes too much to evaluate using this value.. 
you can do this ..

const deferredInput = useDeferredValue(input);

and use it everyware instead of input..
when a rerender happen.. it evaluates immedietly with the old value.. and there fore hte other useMemo or useEffect for example will not run..because it saw no change.. 
and when the input stays some time or may be 100ms with no change.. it rerenderes with last value;
it fires a reernder in the background and when it's ready it apply it .. or someting like that
